Quick Notes: Verizon 4G LTE uses the GSM APN authentication method through a GGSN (similar to AT&T) and 3G (1X/EVDO) traditional uses the HA CDMA method. The old CDMA authentication method has been posted years before so I won't repost that.

From Rajesh:

Hi Don, I am guessing you are hoping to use wvdial, have it as a crontab event @reboot. 
Here is a wvdial config for UML290 with Verizon data plan...

[ Dialer Defaults ]
Init1 = ATZ
Stupid Mode = 1
Dial Command = atdt
New PPPD = yes
Carrier Check = no
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 100000000
Phone = *99***3#
Password = 1
Username = 1

By the way, VZ seems to provide a private IP address to the 4G modems. At the least 
that is what I am getting. Autossh with a reverse ssh hook should give you a path 
back into the device. 

From my personal experience, wvdial works better than sakis3g. 

Cheers!
Raj
